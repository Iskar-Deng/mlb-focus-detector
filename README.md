## Features

- Shows teams, scores, inning, and outs
- Color-coded focus score (higher = redder, lower = bluer)
- Visual base runner display
- Click a game to open its MLB Gameday page
- Click the focus score to open the MLB.TV stream

## Focus Logic

The focus score measures how critical the current game situation is. It's calculated using:
- Inning and half-inning (with bonus weight after the 7th)
- Score difference
- Base/out state
- Win expectancy shift if runs are scored
- Final score is normalized to an integer, where 100 represents the game started.

The more a scoring event would swing the win probability, the higher the focus score.

## How to Use

1. Click the extension icon to view games
2. Click any game to open its Gameday page
3. Click the focus score to open the MLB.TV stream
4. Right-click the extension icon to set your timezone and favorite/follow teams â€” those games will be prioritized
