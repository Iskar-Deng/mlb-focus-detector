## Focus Logic

The focus score measures how critical the current game situation is. It's calculated using:
- Inning and half-inning (with bonus weight after the 7th)
- Score difference
- Base/out state
- Win expectancy shift if runs are scored

Final score is normalized to an integer, where 100 represents the start of the game.  
The more a scoring event would swing the win probability, the higher the focus score.
